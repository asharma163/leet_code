**_Pre-order traversal_** -> visit root node, traverse left-subtree then right sub-tree.

**_In-order traversal_** -> left sub-tree first, then root, them right sub-tree.
Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal.

**_Post-order traversal_** -> left sub-tree first, then right sub-tree then toe root. Deletion process would always be in post-order.
